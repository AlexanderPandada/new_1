# review: Else and If

# [[if-statement]] creates what is called a "branch" in the code
# To evalute it is True or False

people = 30
cars = 40
buses = 15

if cars > people:
    print "we should take the cars."
elif cars < people:
    print "we should not take the cars"
else:
    print "we cannot decide"

if buses > cars:
    print "that is too many buses."
elif buses < cars:
    print "maybe we could take the buses."
else:
    print "we still cannot decide."

if people > buses:
    print "Alright, let us just take the buses."
else:
    print "Fine, let us stay home then."

# order of evaluation:
# if - elif... - else

# if the first is True, it will run only the first one.
