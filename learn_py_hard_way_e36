# Two rules for loops
# 1. use while-loop to loop forever. This only applies to Python; other languages are diffierent.
# 2. use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.

# Rules for If-Statements
# 1. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
#    This means if you put an if in an if, then you should be looking to move that second if into another funciton.

# 2. Every if-statments must have an else.
#    If this else should never be run because it does not make sense(in case it report an error), 
#    then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message. 

# 3. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if, elif, else grouping is like a set of sentences.
#    Put blank lines before and after.

# 4. Elif cannot be jumped over.
